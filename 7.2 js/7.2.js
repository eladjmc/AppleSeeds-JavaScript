// you have this string:
// const string = "The more you know, the more you
// know that you don't know";
// We want to get the index of the last occurrence of the word
// “you”. It should give you 42.
// You can solve this problem without the method indexOf. But
// if you can manage to do it also with indexOf you will get a
// cookie

const string = "The more you know, the more you know that you don't know";

console.log(string.lastIndexOf("you"));
// you can run a loop with length of the string find
//the last index of by advancing but lasIndexOf is more fun and I don't even like cookies
